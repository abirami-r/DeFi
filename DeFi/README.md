# DeFi

Developed a DeFi lending and borrowing DApp deployed on the Ethereum Kovan Network, allowing users to supply tokens for liquidity or as collateral to borrow crypto assets. Users are rewarded with a custom ERC20 token (LAR) based on their supplied amount, and the platform supports stable APY rates for borrowing with real-time price feeds via Chainlink.
